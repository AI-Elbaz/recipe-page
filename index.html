          Look no further for a creamy and ultra smooth classic cheesecake recipe! Paired with a
          buttery graham cracker crust, no one can deny its simple decadence. For the best results, bake in a water
          bath.

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Make the crust</strong>: Using a food processor, pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour
                  into
                  a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together
                  in
                  the food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of
                  a
                  9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup
                  to
                  pack the crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a
                  large
                  piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to
                  slightly cool as you prepare the filling.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Make the filling</strong>: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
                  beat
                  the cream cheese
                  and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is smooth and
                  creamy,
                  about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice then beat until fully combined.
                  On
                  medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended. After the
                  final
                  egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and
                  cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <strong>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</strong> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of
                  water
                  in
                  your roasting
                  pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As the
                  water
                  is
                  heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the
                  crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large
                  roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place
                  the
                  roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the center of the
                  cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door
                  slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove
                  from
                  the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the
                  cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then remove the rim.
                  Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip
                  into
                  warm water between each slice.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up
                  to
                  5 days.
